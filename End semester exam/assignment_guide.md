WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2024
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month;
```

### Step 3.2: Regional Revenue Analysis (3 marks)
```sql
-- Total revenue by region
SELECT 
    region,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_segment) as customer_segments,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_sale
FROM sales_data 
GROUP BY region 
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Step 3.3: Employee Performance by Department (3 marks)
```sql
-- Average performance score by department
SELECT 
    department,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    AVG(performance_score) as avg_performance,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employee_performance 
GROUP BY department 
ORDER BY avg_performance DESC;
```

**Deliverable for Task 3:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Docker containers not starting:**
```bash
# Check Docker Desktop is running
# Try stopping and restarting
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**Cannot connect to MySQL:**
```bash
# Wait 2-3 minutes for MySQL to fully initialize
# Check container logs
docker logs assignment_mysql
```

**Grafana data source connection fails:**
- Ensure you're using `assignment_mysql:3306` as host (not localhost)
- Verify credentials: grafana/grafana123
- Wait for MySQL container to be fully ready

**Time Remaining Alerts:**
- **40 minutes left**: Should have completed Task 1
- **30 minutes left**: Should have completed Task 2  
- **15 minutes left**: Should have completed Task 3
- **5 minutes left**: Focus on submission preparation
